Craig Aitken showed that when a weighted sum of squared residuals is minimized,

^{\hat {\boldsymbol {\beta }}} is the Best Linear Unbiased Estimate if each weight is equal to the reciprocal of the variance of the measurement


{\displaystyle \mathbf {\left(X^{\textsf {T}}WX\right){\hat {\boldsymbol {\beta }}}=X^{\textsf {T}}Wy}}
