Ashar et al. 2022, JAMA Psychiatry
This study is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of patients with chronic back pain (>= 4/10 pain for at least 3 months, average duration ~10 years). The trial compares Pain Reprocessing Therapy, Placebo (a single injection into the skin of the back), and Usual Care treatments, with pre-treatment and post-treatment (1 month after treatment initiation), and follow-up to 1 year.

Let's recreate a GLM from scratch and do an analysis of this dataset.
The goal: Assess whether pain changes with Pain Reprocessing Therapy treatment and/or placebo treatment relative to usual care.
